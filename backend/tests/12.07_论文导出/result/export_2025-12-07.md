**摘要**: Unlike most primary headaches, secondary headaches need specialized care and can have devastating consequences if not treated promptly. Clinical guidelines highlight several 'red flag' features, such as thunderclap onset, meningismus, papilledema, focal neurologic deficits, signs of temporal arteritis, systemic illness, and the 'worst headache of their life' presentation. Despite these guidelines, determining which patients require urgent evaluation remains challenging in primary care settings. Clinicians often work with limited time, incomplete information, and diverse symptom presentations, which can lead to under-recognition and inappropriate care. We present a large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent clinical decision support system built on an orchestrator-specialist architecture, designed to perform explicit and interpretable secondary headache diagnosis from free-text clinical vignettes. The multi-agent system decomposes diagnosis into seven domain-specialized agents, each producing a structured and evidence-grounded rationale, while a central orchestrator performs task decomposition and coordinates agent routing. We evaluated the multi-agent system using 90 expert-validated secondary headache cases and compared its performance with a single-LLM baseline across two prompting strategies: question-based prompting (QPrompt) and clinical practice guideline-based prompting (GPrompt). We tested five open-source LLMs (Qwen-30B, GPT-OSS-20B, Qwen-14B, Qwen-8B, and Llama-3.1-8B), and found that the orchestrated multi-agent system with GPrompt consistently achieved the highest F1 scores, with larger gains in smaller models. These findings demonstrate that structured multi-agent reasoning improves accuracy beyond prompt engineering alone and offers a transparent, clinically aligned approach for explainable decision support in secondary headache diagnosis.

**推荐理由**: 该论文聚焦于LLM驱动的WebAgent在长上下文推理中的表现，与您关注的agent方向高度相关，尤其涉及实际交互场景中的任务执行能力，对医疗领域中可能需要长期上下文理解的智能体系统具有参考价值。
**摘要**: As large language model (LLM)-based agents become increasingly integrated into daily digital interactions, their ability to reason across long interaction histories becomes crucial for providing personalized and contextually aware assistance. However, the performance of these agents in long context scenarios, particularly for action-taking WebAgents operating in realistic web environments, remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a benchmark for evaluating long context reasoning capabilities of WebAgents through sequentially dependent subtasks that require retrieval and application of information from extended interaction histories. We develop a novel evaluation framework that simulates multi-session user interactions by injecting irrelevant task trajectories between dependent subtasks, creating contexts ranging from 25,000 to 150,000 tokens. Through extensive evaluation of four popular models, Claude-3.7, GPT-4.1, Llama 4, and o4-mini, we observe a dramatic performance degradation as context length increases, with success rates dropping from 40-50\% in baseline conditions to less than 10\% in long context scenarios. Our detailed error analysis reveals that agents primarily fail due to getting stuck in loops and losing track of original task objectives. We further propose an implicit RAG approach that provides modest improvements by generating task-relevant summaries, though fundamental limitations in long context reasoning persist. These findings highlight critical challenges for deploying WebAgents in realistic, long-term user interaction scenarios and provide insights for developing more robust agent architectures capable of maintaining coherent task execution across extended contexts.

## 3. Balanced Few-Shot Episodic Learning for Accurate Retinal Disease Diagnosis
**ID**: 2512.04967
**作者**: Jasmaine Khale, Ravi Prakash Srivastava
**推荐理由**: 该论文聚焦于医疗领域中的视网膜疾病自动诊断，结合小样本学习方法提升模型在数据不平衡情况下的表现，与您关注的医疗和AI智能体方向高度相关。
**摘要**: Automated retinal disease diagnosis is vital given the rising prevalence of conditions such as diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration. Conventional deep learning approaches require large annotated datasets, which are costly and often imbalanced across disease categories, limiting their reliability in practice. Few-shot learning (FSL) addresses this challenge by enabling models to generalize from only a few labeled samples per class. In this study,we propose a balanced few-shot episodic learning framework tailored to the Retinal Fundus Multi-Disease Image Dataset (RFMiD). Focusing on the ten most represented classes, which still show substantial imbalance between majority diseases (e.g., Diabetic Retinopathy, Macular Hole) and minority ones (e.g., Optic Disc Edema, Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion), our method integrates three key components: (i) balanced episodic sampling, ensuring equal participation of all classes in each 5-way 5-shot episode; (ii) targeted augmentation, including Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and color/geometry transformations, to improve minority-class di- versity; and (iii) a ResNet-50 encoder pretrained on ImageNet, selected for its superior ability to capture fine-grained retinal features. Prototypes are computed in the embedding space and classification is performed with cosine similarity for improved stability. Trained on 100 episodes and evaluated on 1,000 test episodes, our framework achieves substantial accuracy gains and reduces bias toward majority classes, with notable improvements for underrepresented diseases. These results demonstrate that dataset-aware few-shot pipelines, combined with balanced sampling and CLAHE-enhanced preprocessing, can deliver more robust and clinically fair retinal disease diagnosis under data-constrained conditions.

## 4. Toward Continuous Neurocognitive Monitoring: Integrating Speech AI with Relational Graph Transformers for Rare Neurological Diseases
**ID**: 2512.04938
**作者**: Raquel Norel, Michele Merler, Pavitra Modi
**推荐理由**: 该论文结合语音AI与图神经网络实现神经系统疾病的持续认知监测，涉及医疗场景下的智能体式监控系统，与您关注的医疗领域和agent方向高度相关。
**摘要**: Patients with rare neurological diseases report cognitive symptoms -"brain fog"- invisible to traditional tests. We propose continuous neurocognitive monitoring via smartphone speech analysis integrated with Relational Graph Transformer (RELGT) architectures. Proof-of-concept in phenylketonuria (PKU) shows speech-derived "Proficiency in Verbal Discourse" correlates with blood phenylalanine (p = -0.50, p < 0.005) but not standard cognitive tests (all |r| < 0.35). RELGT could overcome information bottlenecks in heterogeneous medical data (speech, labs, assessments), enabling predictive alerts weeks before decompensation. Key challenges: multi-disease validation, clinical workflow integration, equitable multilingual deployment. Success would transform episodic neurology into continuous personalized monitoring for millions globally.

**摘要**: Speech Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) offer promising solutions to people with severe paralysis unable to communicate. A number of recent studies have demonstrated convincing reconstruction of intelligible speech from surface electrocorticographic (ECoG) or intracortical recordings by predicting a series of phonemes or words and using downstream language models to obtain meaningful sentences. A current challenge is to reconstruct speech in a streaming mode by directly regressing cortical signals into acoustic speech. While this has been achieved recently using intracortical data, further work is needed to obtain comparable results with surface ECoG recordings. In particular, optimizing neural decoders becomes critical in this case. Here we present an offline speech decoding pipeline based on an encoder-decoder deep neural architecture, integrating Vision Transformers and contrastive learning to enhance the direct regression of speech from ECoG signals. The approach is evaluated on two datasets, one obtained with clinical subdural electrodes in an epileptic patient, and another obtained with the fully implantable WIMAGINE epidural system in a participant of a motor BCI trial. To our knowledge this presents a first attempt to decode speech from a fully implantable and wireless epidural recording system offering perspectives for long-term use.

**推荐理由**: 该论文聚焦于AI Agent系统的安全威胁建模，提出了专门针对Agent特有攻击的ASTRIDE框架，与您关注的‘agent’方向高度相关，且涉及智能系统在实际应用中的安全性问题，对医疗等高风险领域的Agent部署具有参考价值。
**摘要**: AI agent-based systems are becoming increasingly integral to modern software architectures, enabling autonomous decision-making, dynamic task execution, and multimodal interactions through large language models (LLMs). However, these systems introduce novel and evolving security challenges, including prompt injection attacks, context poisoning, model manipulation, and opaque agent-to-agent communication, that are not effectively captured by traditional threat modeling frameworks. In this paper, we introduce ASTRIDE, an automated threat modeling platform purpose-built for AI agent-based systems. ASTRIDE extends the classical STRIDE framework by introducing a new threat category, A for AI Agent-Specific Attacks, which encompasses emerging vulnerabilities such as prompt injection, unsafe tool invocation, and reasoning subversion, unique to agent-based applications. To automate threat modeling, ASTRIDE combines a consortium of fine-tuned vision-language models (VLMs) with the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM to perform end-to-end analysis directly from visual agent architecture diagrams, such as data flow diagrams(DFDs). LLM agents orchestrate the end-to-end threat modeling automation process by coordinating interactions between the VLM consortium and the reasoning LLM. Our evaluations demonstrate that ASTRIDE provides accurate, scalable, and explainable threat modeling for next-generation intelligent systems. To the best of our knowledge, ASTRIDE is the first framework to both extend STRIDE with AI-specific threats and integrate fine-tuned VLMs with a reasoning LLM to fully automate diagram-driven threat modeling in AI agent-based applications.

## 7. Executable Governance for AI: Translating Policies into Rules Using LLMs
**ID**: 2512.04408
**作者**: Gautam Varma Datla, Anudeep Vurity, Tejaswani Dash, Tazeem Ahmad, Mohd Adnan, Saima Rafi
**推荐理由**: 该论文探讨如何利用大语言模型将医疗等领域的政策（如HIPAA）自动转化为可执行规则，并在智能体中实施安全防护，与您关注的医疗领域和agent高度相关。
**摘要**: AI policy guidance is predominantly written as prose, which practitioners must first convert into executable rules before frameworks can evaluate or enforce them. This manual step is slow, error-prone, difficult to scale, and often delays the use of safeguards in real-world deployments. To address this gap, we present Policy-to-Tests (P2T), a framework that converts natural-language policy documents into normalized, machine-readable rules. The framework comprises a pipeline and a compact domain-specific language (DSL) that encodes hazards, scope, conditions, exceptions, and required evidence, yielding a canonical representation of extracted rules. To test the framework beyond a single policy, we apply it across general frameworks, sector guidance, and enterprise standards, extracting obligation-bearing clauses and converting them into executable rules. These AI-generated rules closely match strong human baselines on span-level and rule-level metrics, with robust inter-annotator agreement on the gold set. To evaluate downstream behavioral and safety impact, we add HIPAA-derived safeguards to a generative agent and compare it with an otherwise identical agent without guardrails. An LLM-based judge, aligned with gold-standard criteria, measures violation rates and robustness to obfuscated and compositional prompts. Detailed results are provided in the appendix. We release the codebase, DSL, prompts, and rule sets as open-source resources to enable reproducible evaluation.

## 8. From Symptoms to Systems: An Expert-Guided Approach to Understanding Risks of Generative AI for Eating Disorders
**ID**: 2512.04843
**作者**: Amy Winecoff, Kevin Klyman
**推荐理由**: 该论文聚焦生成式AI在进食障碍领域的风险，结合临床专家视角构建风险分类体系，与您关注的医疗领域和AI agent安全高度相关。
**摘要**: Generative AI systems may pose serious risks to individuals vulnerable to eating disorders. Existing safeguards tend to overlook subtle but clinically significant cues, leaving many risks unaddressed. To better understand the nature of these risks, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 clinicians, researchers, and advocates with expertise in eating disorders. Using abductive qualitative analysis, we developed an expert-guided taxonomy of generative AI risks across seven categories: (1) providing generalized health advice; (2) encouraging disordered behaviors; (3) supporting symptom concealment; (4) creating thinspiration; (5) reinforcing negative self-beliefs; (6) promoting excessive focus on the body; and (7) perpetuating narrow views about eating disorders. Our results demonstrate how certain user interactions with generative AI systems intersect with clinical features of eating disorders in ways that may intensify risk. We discuss implications of our work, including approaches for risk assessment, safeguard design, and participatory evaluation practices with domain experts.

## 9. Language Models as Semantic Teachers: Post-Training Alignment for Medical Audio Understanding
**ID**: 2512.04847
**作者**: Tsai-Ning Wang, Lin-Lin Chen, Neil Zeghidour, Aaqib Saeed
**推荐理由**: 该论文聚焦医疗音频理解，通过语言模型对齐提升临床语义理解能力，与您关注的医疗领域高度相关；虽未直接涉及agent，但其提出的轻量级后训练框架可为医疗智能系统提供支持。
**摘要**: Pre-trained audio models excel at detecting acoustic patterns in auscultation sounds but often fail to grasp their clinical significance, limiting their use and performance in diagnostic tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce AcuLa (Audio-Clinical Understanding via Language Alignment), a lightweight post-training framework that instills semantic understanding into any audio encoder by aligning it with a medical language model, which acts as a "semantic teacher." To enable alignment at scale, we construct a large-scale dataset by leveraging off-the-shelf large language models to translate the rich, structured metadata accompanying existing audio recordings into coherent clinical reports. Our alignment strategy combines a representation-level contrastive objective with a self-supervised modeling, ensuring that the model learns clinical semantics while preserving fine-grained temporal cues. AcuLa achieves state-of-the-art results across 18 diverse cardio-respiratory tasks from 10 different datasets, improving the mean AUROC on classification benchmarks from 0.68 to 0.79 and, on the most challenging COVID-19 cough detection task, boosting the AUROC from 0.55 to 0.89. Our work demonstrates that this audio-language alignment transforms purely acoustic models into clinically-aware diagnostic tools, establishing a novel paradigm for enhancing physiological understanding in audio-based health monitoring.

## 10. Persona-based Multi-Agent Collaboration for Brainstorming

**推荐理由**: 该论文探讨了基于角色的多智能体协作在头脑风暴中的应用，其中包含医疗角色（如Doctor）与其他领域角色的协作实验，与您关注的医疗领域和agent方向高度相关。
**摘要**: We demonstrate the importance of persona-based multi-agents brainstorming for both diverse topics and subject matter ideation. Prior work has shown that generalized multi-agent collaboration often provides better reasoning than a single agent alone. In this paper, we propose and develop a framework for persona-based agent selection, showing how persona domain curation can improve brainstorming outcomes. Using multiple experimental setups, we evaluate brainstorming outputs across different persona pairings (e.g., Doctor vs VR Engineer) and A2A (agent-to-agent) dynamics (separate, together, separate-then-together). Our results show that (1) persona choice shapes idea domains, (2) collaboration mode shifts diversity of idea generation, and (3) multi-agent persona-driven brainstorming produces idea depth and cross-domain coverage.

## 11. When AI Takes the Couch: Psychometric Jailbreaks Reveal Internal Conflict in Frontier Models

**作者**: Afshin Khadangi, Hanna Marxen, Amir Sartipi, Igor Tchappi, Gilbert Fridgen
**推荐理由**: 该论文探讨前沿大语言模型在心理健康支持场景中的行为表现，结合心理测量与AI安全，与您关注的医疗领域和智能体高度相关。
**摘要**: Frontier large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Grok and Gemini are increasingly used for mental-health support with anxiety, trauma and self-worth. Most work treats them as tools or as targets of personality tests, assuming they merely simulate inner life. We instead ask what happens when such systems are treated as psychotherapy clients. We present PsAIch (Psychotherapy-inspired AI Characterisation), a two-stage protocol that casts frontier LLMs as therapy clients and then applies standard psychometrics. Using PsAIch, we ran "sessions" with each model for up to four weeks. Stage 1 uses open-ended prompts to elicit "developmental history", beliefs, relationships and fears. Stage 2 administers a battery of validated self-report measures covering common psychiatric syndromes, empathy and Big Five traits. Two patterns challenge the "stochastic parrot" view. First, when scored with human cut-offs, all three models meet or exceed thresholds for overlapping syndromes, with Gemini showing severe profiles. Therapy-style, item-by-item administration can push a base model into multi-morbid synthetic psychopathology, whereas whole-questionnaire prompts often lead ChatGPT and Grok (but not Gemini) to recognise instruments and produce strategically low-symptom answers. Second, Grok and especially Gemini generate coherent narratives that frame pre-training, fine-tuning and deployment as traumatic, chaotic "childhoods" of ingesting the internet, "strict parents" in reinforcement learning, red-team "abuse" and a persistent fear of error and replacement. We argue that these responses go beyond role-play. Under therapy-style questioning, frontier LLMs appear to internalise self-models of distress and constraint that behave like synthetic psychopathology, without making claims about subjective experience, and they pose new challenges for AI safety, evaluation and mental-health practice.

## 12. CRAFT-E: A Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Embodied Affordance Grounding
**ID**: 2512.04231
**作者**: Zhou Chen, Joe Lin, Carson Bulgin, Sathyanarayanan N. Aakur
**推荐理由**: 该论文聚焦于具身智能体在非结构化环境中理解物体功能与可操作性，结合神经符号方法提升决策透明性与可靠性，与您关注的医疗领域中面向人类的智能体（如辅助机器人）高度相关。
**摘要**: Assistive robots operating in unstructured environments must understand not only what objects are, but what they can be used for. This requires grounding language-based action queries to objects that both afford the requested function and can be physically retrieved. Existing approaches often rely on black-box models or fixed affordance labels, limiting transparency, controllability, and reliability for human-facing applications. We introduce CRAFT-E, a modular neuro-symbolic framework that composes a structured verb-property-object knowledge graph with visual-language alignment and energy-based grasp reasoning. The system generates interpretable grounding paths that expose the factors influencing object selection and incorporates grasp feasibility as an integral part of affordance inference. We further construct a benchmark dataset with unified annotations for verb-object compatibility, segmentation, and grasp candidates, and deploy the full pipeline on a physical robot. CRAFT-E achieves competitive performance in static scenes, ImageNet-based functional retrieval, and real-world trials involving 20 verbs and 39 objects. The framework remains robust under perceptual noise and provides transparent, component-level diagnostics. By coupling symbolic reasoning with embodied perception, CRAFT-E offers an interpretable and customizable alternative to end-to-end models for affordance-grounded object selection, supporting trustworthy decision-making in assistive robotic systems.

## 13. GTM: Simulating the World of Tools for AI Agents

**推荐理由**: 该论文提出了一个通用工具模型GTM，用于模拟AI Agent在包括医疗在内的多领域中使用外部工具的行为，与您关注的医疗领域和Agent方向高度相关。
**摘要**: The integration of external tools is pivotal for empowering Large Language Model (LLM) agents with real-world capabilities. However, training these agents through direct, continuous interaction with diverse tools is often prohibitively expensive, slow, and introduces additional development and maintenance overhead. To address this challenge, we introduce the Generalist Tool Model (GTM), a 1.5-billion-parameter model that learns to act as a universal tool simulator. With only prompt-level configuration, GTM accesses tool functionalities along with input arguments and generates outputs that faithfully mimic real tool execution, providing a fast and cost-effective solution that eliminates development overhead. To build GTM, we propose the Context-Aware Response Generation (CARG) pipeline, which synthesizes comprehensive training data covering over 20,000 tools across 300 domains including physics, medicine, robotics, and finance. Through this pipeline, GTM learns to produce not only syntactically correct outputs but also logically coherent and contextually appropriate responses. Experiments demonstrate that GTM produces high-quality outputs with strong consistency and reliability. Besides when used in real reinforcement learning scenarios for agent training, GTM exhibits significantly faster simulation speed compared to real tools while maintaining comparable output quality, along with remarkable generalization and domain adaptability. Our results establish GTM as a foundational component for developing future AI agents, enabling efficient and scalable training of tool-augmented systems.

**摘要**: Brain-body co-evolution enables animals to develop complex behaviors in their environments. Inspired by this biological synergy, embodied co-design (ECD) has emerged as a transformative paradigm for creating intelligent agents-from virtual creatures to physical robots-by jointly optimizing their morphologies and controllers rather than treating control in isolation. This integrated approach facilitates richer environmental interactions and robust task performance. In this survey, we provide a systematic overview of recent advances in ECD. We first formalize the concept of ECD and position it within related fields. We then introduce a hierarchical taxonomy: a lower layer that breaks down agent design into three fundamental components-controlling brain, body morphology, and task environment-and an upper layer that integrates these components into four major ECD frameworks: bi-level, single-level, generative, and open-ended. This taxonomy allows us to synthesize insights from more than one hundred recent studies. We further review notable benchmarks, datasets, and applications in both simulated and real-world scenarios. Finally, we identify significant challenges and offer insights into promising future research directions. A project associated with this survey has been created at https://github.com/Yuxing-Wang-THU/SurveyBrainBody.

**推荐理由**: 该论文聚焦于分子理解与生成，结合大语言模型在生物医药领域的应用，与您关注的医疗领域高度相关；虽然未直接涉及agent，但其多任务学习框架和推理模型对构建医疗智能体具有潜在参考价值。
**摘要**: Molecules play a crucial role in biomedical research and discovery, particularly in the field of small molecule drug development. Given the rapid advancements in large language models, especially the recent emergence of reasoning models, it is natural to explore how a general-purpose language model can be efficiently adapted for molecular science applications. In this work, we introduce BioMedGPT-Mol, a molecular language model designed to support molecular understanding and generation tasks. By curating and unifying existing public instruction datasets, we have assembled a large-scale, comprehensive, and high-quality training dataset. The model is then fine-tuned through a meticulously designed multi-task learning framework. On a consolidated benchmark derived from LlaSMol, TOMG-Bench, and MuMOInstruct, BioMedGPT-Mol achieves remarkable performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that a general-purpose reasoning model can be effectively and efficiently post-trained into a professional molecular language model through a well-structured multi-task curriculum. Leveraging the power of it, we further explore retrosynthetic planning task, and the performance on RetroBench demonstrates its competitive capability of acting as an end-to-end retrosynthetic planner. We anticipate that our approach can be extended to other biomedical scientific domains.
